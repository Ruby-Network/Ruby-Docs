## Self Hosting Via Terminal

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Installation

- Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ruby-Network/Ruby.git
```

- Install the dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

- make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

- Edit the `.env` file and change the `URL` to the url you want to use (leave blank to disable)
- Edit the `.env` file and change the `PORT` to the port you want to use (leave blank to use 8080)
- If you just want to use the default settings you can skip this step
- Start the server

```bash
$ yarn prod
```

- Open your browser and go to `localhost:8080`

## Alternatives for Hosting

### Docker Installation

#### Requirements

- Install docker and docker-compose (if you don't have it already)

#### Installation

- Copy the docker compose example below and paste it into a file called `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  ruby:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: "ghcr.io/ruby-network/ruby:main"
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    #ADVANCED ITEMS BELOW
    #env_file:
    #     - .env.docker
    #environment:
    #     - URL=${URL}
#networks:
#  default:
#    external:
#      name: default_net
```

- You can also just simply curl the docker-compose.yml file from github

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruby-Network/ruby/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```

- Change `<your port here>` to the port you want to use removing the `<>` around it.
- Run the docker-compose file

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Docker Only Installation

- Run the following command

```bash
$ docker run -d -p <your port here>:8080 --restart unless-stopped --name ruby ghcr.io/ruby-network/ruby
```

- Change `<your port here>` to the port you want to use removing the `<>` around it.

---

#### Advanced docker compose setup

- Make a .env.docker file and paste the following into it

```mdx
PORT=8080
URL=http://localhost:8080
```

- Change the `PORT` to the port you want to use
- Change the `URL` to the url you want to use (leave blank or delete to disable)
- Change your docker-compose.yml file to look like this

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  ruby:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: "ghcr.io/ruby-network/ruby:main"
    ports:
      #    - <your port here>:8080
      #ADVANCED ITEMS BELOW
      - ${PORT}:8080
    env_file:
      - .env.docker
    environment:
      - URL=${URL}
#networks:
#  default:
#    external:
#      name: default_net
```

- Run the docker-compose file

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
